BRAIN STATE DYNAMICS (BSD) - HSMM AND VARIATIONAL BAYES
This toolbox allows for brain state (BS) inference using a Hidden Markov Model or Hidden semi-Markov Model. It can be used to both real-data analysis and data simulation. Examples are provided for both cases.

The author of the toolbox is Dr. David Araya from the Brain Dynamics Laboratory.
